Reporting a bug
===============

Whenever you find a bug in the QA Tools, we kindly ask you to report it. It
helps us make it better!

Before submitting a bug:

* double-check the official [documentation][qa-tools-docs] to see if you're not
  misusing the tools;
* verify someone else hasn't already reported your issue in the
  [issue tracker](qa-tools-issues).

If your problem definitely looks like a bug, report it using the
[issue tracker](qa-tools-issues) and follow some basic rules:

* use the title field to clearly describe the issue;
* describe the steps needed to reproduce the bug;
* and give as much detail as possible about your environment (OS, PHP version,
  enabled extensions, ...).

# Ibuildings QA Tools v3 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ibuildingsnl/qa-tools-v3.svg?token=JEaBsbhAuRqMRnCxyjuy&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ibuildingsnl/qa-tools-v3)
A set of quality assurance tools that are easily configurable through an installer.

The QA Tools are meant to provide you with a decent base build setup, conforming to Ibuildings standards. 
They are not meant to provide a solution for every use case. If you want a more complex setup,
you can use the resulting configurations as a base and configure it manually.
